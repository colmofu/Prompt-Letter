# Prompt-Letter

## Description

This is a small project for personal use in my search for work. The idea is to create an initial draft of a cover letter for potential job applications
using prompt engineering and GPT models.

The model takes in as arguments a pdf of the job posting and a pdf of the applicant's resume, analyzing it for text. GPT then uses this to construct a conventional and job/applicant-relevant cover letter.

The user can also specify the occupation field and the output language (English and German).

__NOTE__ : One should be aware before using this program that due to its reliance on GPT models, users are potentially passing sensitive and private personal data to OpenAI. Please take the opportunity to inform yourself about this risk and whether or not it is something you desire. All risk belongs to the user.

## Installation and Usage

Users require their own OPEN_API key for use of this program. I have saved mine as an environment variable.

## Credits

The idea for this concept belongs to Armando Cortez. I implemented my own version of his idea simply for my own personal use and using my own ideas for how it could be developed. This is simply a personal project to improve my prompt engineering skills and I have no desire to profit off it.

Code is original and my own.

## Requirements

A list of required packages is found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Known Bugs

## Future Improvements

If you have ideas or improvements, please reach out! The goal of this project is to improve my prompt-engineering skills, so I'm very open to ideas.

If I have time, I would like to add more user interaction and a front-end to this program.
